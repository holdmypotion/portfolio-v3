# Seek My Product

An intelligent product discovery platform that helps users find exactly what they're looking for through AI-powered recommendations and smart search capabilities.

## Features

- **AI-Powered Search**: Natural language product search using OpenAI's API
- **Smart Recommendations**: Personalized product suggestions based on user behavior
- **Real-time Filtering**: Dynamic filters for price, category, brand, and ratings
- **User Reviews & Ratings**: Community-driven product feedback system
- **Wishlist Management**: Save and organize favorite products
- **Price Tracking**: Monitor price changes and get alerts for deals

## Architecture

The platform follows a modern full-stack architecture:

1. **Frontend**: React with TypeScript for type safety
2. **Backend**: Node.js with Express API server
3. **Database**: MongoDB for flexible product data storage
4. **Caching**: Redis for session management and search optimization
5. **AI Integration**: OpenAI API for natural language processing
6. **Authentication**: JWT-based user authentication

## Key Technical Highlights

### Smart Search Implementation

```javascript
// AI-powered search that understands natural language
const searchProducts = async (query) => {
  const aiResponse = await openai.completions.create({
    model: 'text-davinci-003',
    prompt: `Convert this search query into product categories and attributes: "${query}"`,
    max_tokens: 150,
  });

  return processSearchResults(aiResponse.choices[0].text);
};
```

### Real-time Recommendations

- Machine learning algorithm analyzes user behavior patterns
- Collaborative filtering for "users like you" suggestions
- Content-based filtering using product attributes
- A/B testing for recommendation algorithm optimization

## Performance Metrics

- **Search Response Time**: < 200ms average
- **Recommendation Accuracy**: 78% user satisfaction rate
- **Monthly Active Users**: 15K+ users
- **Database Queries**: Optimized with indexing (< 50ms average)

## Challenges Solved

1. **Scale**: Handling 10K+ products with efficient search and filtering
2. **Relevance**: Implementing semantic search to understand user intent
3. **Performance**: Optimizing API responses with Redis caching
4. **User Experience**: Creating intuitive filters and smooth interactions

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Mobile app development (React Native)
- [ ] Voice search integration
- [ ] AR product visualization
- [ ] Social commerce features
- [ ] Multi-language support
