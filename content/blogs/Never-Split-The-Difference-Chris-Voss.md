# Chapter 1 | The New Rules

Here comes the first mention of calibrated questions.
Calibrated Questions: Open-ended questions that the other side can respond to but has no fixed answers. Buys you time and sets up an Illusion of control in the mind of the counterpart.

> Listening is the cheapest, yet most effective concession we can make in a negotiation. —Chris Voss
> By listening intensely, one shows empathy and a sincere desire to better understand the counterparts viewpoints.

> The first step to achieving a mastery of daily negotiation is to get over your aversion to negotiating. You don't need to like it; you just need to understand that's how the world works! —Chris Voss
> "That's right" instead of "Yes"

# Chapter 2 | Be A Mirror

True, active and avid listening is the best way to stop the voice in your head and prioritizing the argument. It is the only way in and out of the negotiation.
It is about making the conversation about them. Validating their emotions and creating enough trust so that the real conversation can begin!

> Going too fast is one of the mistakes all negotiators are prone to making.—Chris Voss
> Most easy and immediately effective mode of influence that people tend to overlook is the general demeanor and delivery of words.
> ==late-night FM Dj voice works best to setup control and authority over the situation and make a point. Inflect your voice downward, keeping it calm and slow.==

## Mirroring

Simply put, it is way to repeat last words of last dialogue delivered by the counterpart. This let them speak and elaborate more expressing more information. Best part about this is that it isn't offensive like "What? I didn't understand!", "Why?", etc. Other way around puts the counterpart in defensive mode hiding valuable information.
Remember!! The intention behind the mirror should be—"Please, help me understand." rather then "What do you mean by that?"

## Confrontation

If you take a pit bull approach with another pit bull, you generally end up with a messy scene. There are 4 single steps to get your way—without confrontation.

1. Use the late-night FM Dj Voice
2. Start with "I'm sorry..." and then
3. Mirror. Let them elaborate and get their intentions out.
4. Silence. At least four seconds, to let the mirror work its magic on your counterpart
5. Repeat
   **Mirroring will make you feel awkward as fuck when you first try it.**

## Key Lessons

- Use your skills to listen and dig up the real conversation.
- Don't commit to assumption. Keep verifying your hypothesis.
- Seek to understand.
- Slow it down: Build rapport and trust.
- Put a smile on your face: This literally eases up the interaction even on a phone call.

> We fear what's different and are drawn to what's similar—Chris Voss
> This is the reason why mirrors works like a charm.

# Chapter 3 | Don't Feel Their Pain, Label It

## Tactical Empathy

> The ability to recognize the perspective of a counterpart, and the vocalization of that recognition. —Chris Voss
> To increase your neural resonance skills, practice turning your complete attention to someone who's talking, visualize your self in there position and put in as much detail as your can.
> This simply leads to one goal and that is understanding the position of your counterpart and learning why their actions/decisions matter to them, and also what might move them.

Empathy is the tool that lets you exercise the supreme art of war.

> "The supreme art of war": to subdue the enemy without fighting.—Chris Voss
> _Empathetic listening is really a super power as almost all of the time people are looking for just one opening to let our their sorrows and problems out to someone who can understand them. It's true, seriously try this!!_

## Labeling

Excerpt from one incident from the book

> We didn't just put ourselves in the fugitives' shoes. We spotted their feelings, turned then into words, and then very calmly and respectfully repeated their emotions back to them.

> Labeling is a way of validating someone's emotion by acknowledging it —Chris Voss
> Labeling in simple terms is just applying rational words to a fear. The moment a deep hidden intense fear is addressed, it's intensity decreases.
> _So fucking true!!!_
> The trick to find these fears is to observe very carefully at the reactions or changes people undergo on different stimulus(Most of the time, your words).
> ==**Labels almost begins with roughly the same words:**==

- It seems like.....
- It sounds like....
- It looks like.....
  Rule of thumb: Never start a label with "I". "I am hearing that...", etc. This drops the complete responsibility of the content of the label on your shoulders. And also, it portrays that the conversation in about you (Though, it's not).
  **==The last rule of labeling is SILENCE==**
  After the label has been thrown, silence from your side should follow. The whole purpose of label is to let your counterpart open up and become the speaker.

## Neutralize the Negative, Reinforce the Positive

> Labeling negatives diffuses them; labeling positives reinforces
> The fastest and the most efficient way to build a quick working relationship is to acknowledge the negative diffuse it.
> According to certain researches, the best way to deal with negativity is to observe it, without reaction and without judgement. Then labeling each negative feeling and replace it with positive, compassionate, and solution-based thoughts.

> Empathy is a powerful mood enhancer—Chris Voss

## Do an accusation audit

According to author in accusation audit you are to list every terrible thing your counterpart could say about you.
When you start a hard negotiation that is probably going to upset the counterpart. The best way is to go through an accusation audit prior to the negotiation.
When all the underlying bad feeling and accusation are addressed aloud by you, they loose their intensity even in your counterparts heart.

### Negotiation plan till now

Listen; Mirror; Listen; tactical empathy; label; then only make a request.
This was explained with a brilliant example of a person who got a seat with a special upgrade on a sold out flight, just by listening and empathizing with the gate agent.

## Key Lessons

- "The reason why a counterpart will not make an agreement with you are often more powerful than why they will make a deal." So focus on clearing those barriers first.
- Pause. Silence after the label is crucial.
- The accusations addressed by you anyway sound exaggerated and encourage the counterpart to claim quite the opposite.
- Diffuse the Negative and Reinforce the Positive

# Chapter 4 | Beware "Yes"—Master "No"

> For good negotiators, "No" is pure gold.—Chris

## "No" starts the negotiation.

> A trap into which many fall is to take what other people say literally.—Chris
> **==Example reply to a "No":==**

- "What about this doesn't work for you?"
- "What would you need to make it work?"
- "It seems like there's something here that bothers you"

## Persuade in their world

### Three kinds of "Yes"

- Counterfeit: Counterpart plans to say "No" but says "Yes". This is suppressive and suppression never works for long term
- Confirmation: Just a yes. Agreement to a though. No promise of action.
- Commitment: This is the real deal. Promise of action. Total agreement.

> An early "Yes" is often just a cheap, counterfeit dodge.
> Look for a "That's right" not a "You're right"

> Almost everyone is driven by two primal urges, the need to feel safe and secure, and the need to feel in control. If you satisfy those drives, you're in the door.

## "No" is protection

> "No" gives the speaker the feeling of safety, security, and control.
> A solid "No" is the sign that your counterpart in engaged in the conversation and is evaluating your words wisely. It begins the process of negotiation.
> So, preferred methods to start a conversation if you are a telemarketer can be: "Is now a bad time to talk?" rather than "Do you have a few minutes to talk?" The former one is answered mostly with a "No" and the later one other way around.

### Features of "NO"

- allows the real issues to be brought forth;
- protects people from making—and lets them correct—ineffective decisions;
- slows things down so that people can freely embrace their decisions and the agreements they enter into;
- helps people feel safe, secure, emotionally comfortable, and in control of their decisions;
- moves everyone's efforts forward.

_In a nut shell turn almost all your build up questions upside down just like the example of the telemarketer☝_
==**Ways to bring out "No"**==

- Intentionally mislabel one of the other party's emotion or desire. For instance, "So it seems that you really are eager to leave your job!"—REPLY: "No, that's not it, This ....... is it"
- Directly ask the your counterpart to the things they would say "No" to related to the matter.

## Key lessons

- "No" is not a failure. It is rather "I am not comfortable with that". So make it comfortable!
- "Yes" is the final goal!
- Persuasion is not about how bright or smooth or forceful you are. It's about the other party convincing themselves that the solution you want is their own idea. So don't beat them with logic or brute force. Ask them questions that open paths to your goals. It's not about you!
- Email Magic: If you are being ignored on emails. Go for this: "Have you given up on this project?" Most of the time you'll receive a quick "No!!!"

# Chapter 5 | Trigger The Two Words That Immediately Transform Any Negotiation

> "That's right!!"

## Trigger a "That's right" with a summary

**Steps**

1. Effective Pause: Silence is powerful at right moments.
2. Minimal Encourages: "Yes", "OK", "Uh-huh", "I see", etc.
3. Mirroring: Refer☝
4. Labeling: Refer☝
5. Paraphrase: Repeating what is being heard in your own words. This ensures the counterpart that you are not just parroting but literally they are being heard.
6. Summarize: Paraphrasing + Labeling
   The end result has is most likely a "That's right" response.

> Driving toward "that's right" is a winning strategy in all negotiations. But hearing "you're right" is a disaster.
> _And all of my fucking life, I have been going for a "you're right!!"_
> The use of summary is exemplified by the author as
> Back story: Author's son, Brandon, is/was an America Football player, playing as lineman(Supposed to block the linebreakers) for a long time. When he was moved to being a linebreaker(supposed to dodge the lineman and score) he was on a constant spree of hitting rather then dodging the lineman. After repetitive attempts from author and Brandon's coach, they only got a "you're right" reply. But then......
> "You seem to think it's unmanly to dodge a block"—paraphrasing. "You think it's cowardly to get out of someone's way that's trying to hit you"—labelling. And he got a "that's right" reply! This magically changed his course.

## Key lessons

- Creating unconditional positive regard open the door to changing thoughts and behaviors.
- "That's right" is better than "Yes"
- Use summary.

# Chapter 6 | Bend The Reality

> There's always leverage. Negotiation is never a linear formula: add X to Y to get Z. We all have irrational blind spots, hidden needs, and undeveloped notions.—Chris Voss.

## Don't Compromise

Never split the difference

> Creative solution are almost always preceded by some degree of risk annoyance, confusion and conflict!—Chris Voss

> No deal is better than a bad deal.—Chris Voss
> If that mantra can truly he internalized, and you understand that you have all the time you need. Your patience becomes a formidable wepon.

### Deadlines

Deadlines cut both ways. For instance car dealers give away best offers at the end of the month/year. In this case knowing the deadline of the car dealer works best for you! On the flip side, by reavling your deadline your could recieve benefits in two ways.

1. It reduces the risk of non-agreement
2. The "real" conversation/deal starts early off.

## Using the word "Fair"

> We make decisions/choices just to get 'Fair' with the world.
> We are generally guiding through life and making crucial decisions based on the current state of the world around us. Just to make it simple, everyone has this urge to be better than someone and have what most people have.
> Reference from the book: "Iran has screwed itself out of its chief source of income—oil and gas revenue—in order to pursue an energy project with little expected pay off.—Just because it's not fair that global powers—which together have several thousand nuclear weapons—should be able to decide if it can use nuclear energy."

### Use

- "We just want what's fair" this is perfect to rattle your counterpart.
- Just BTW response to such question can be "Let's stop everything and go back to where I started treating you unfairly and we'll fix it."
- Use "F" on "F"
- "I want you to feel like you are bring treated fairly at all times. So please stop me at any time if you feel I'm being unfair, and we'll address it."

## The hidden emotional desires

If you can unravel the deeply hidden problem, pain and unmet objective, you can actually figure out what the counterpart is actually buying. This becomes the opportunity to present your proposal as the perfect solution.

## Bend the reality

> To get leverage, you have to persuade them that they have something concrete to lose if the deal falls through.—Chris

### Anchor their emotions

- An accusation audit can be used to address you counterpart's fears and anchor their emotions to rile up their loss aversion.
- For instance: "I got a lousy proposition for you—By the time we get off the phone, you're going to think I'm a lousy businessman. You're going to think I can't budget or plan. You're going to thing Chris Voss is a big talker. Hist first big project ever out of the FBI, he screws it up completely. He doesn't know how to run an operation. And he might even have lied to me."—Address all the fears and lowered the expectations. "Still, I wanted to bring this opportunity to you before I took it to someone else,"—Every one of em' took the deal!!!!!

### Let the other guy go first...most of the time.

Let the counterpart anchor the monetary negotiations. This gives you a perspective to put forward you offer! The only thing to mind is, if the other person is an expert then prepare yourself mentally for an extream anchore.

> Anchor and Adjustment—chris

### Establish a range.

- Go for an extream anchor and with a range. Expect then to fall to the lowest value in the range, though

### Pivot to nonmoneytary terms

If the offer is low, you could ask for things that matter more to you than to them

### When you do talk numbers, use ODD one

$37,263—feels like a figure that you came to as a result of mathematical deduction.

### Suprise with a gift

To portray the feeling of being out of money(In terms of negotiating a kindnap), offer nonmonetary things with an odd number. $4751 with a CD Stereo is an example.

## Negotiating a better salary

- Be pleasantly persistent on non-salary terms: For eg. an extra vacation beyond normal release by the company for a specific reason. Something like this is generally compensated by a salary raise.
- Salary terms without success terms is russian roulette: Make sure to define success for your position + metrics for your next raise. This is meaningful and free for you boss.
- Spark their interest in your success and gain an unofficial mentor: Rather than just selling yourself as a body for the job, sell your success as a way they can validate their own intelligence and broadcast it to the rest of the company. The key here is, If someone gives you guidance, they expect you to follow. You've just recruited your first unofficial mentor.

## Key lessons

- All negotiations are defined by a network of subterranean desires and needs.
- Spliting the difference is wearing one black and one brown shoe, so don't compromise.
- Approaching deadlines force people to act impulsively against their best interest
- Use a high anchor with a range to seem less aggressive
- Ignite their Loss aversion

# Chapter 7 | Create The Illusion Of Control

What negotiations are not: A wrestling match where the point is to exhaust your opponent into submission, hope for the best, and never back down. eg: "You can't leave"
What negotiations actually are: Getting your counterpart to do the work for you and suggest your solution himself. It involved giving him the illusion of control while you, in fact, were the one defining the conversation. eg: "I understand that you're pissed off. I just want to understand what do you hope to achieve by going?"

> The best way to ride a horse is in the direction in which it is going
> Don't persuade your counterpart to see your idea. Instead lead them to your idea.

### Open ended questions

These questions allow you to introduce ideas and requests without sounding overbearing or pushy.

> He who has learned to disagree without being disagreeable has discovered the most valuable secret of negotiation—Robert Estabrook
> **==Use "how"==**
> "How am I supposed to do that?" is the best way to disagree as you are actually asking for there help. They feel in control. Your counterpart will do the thinking in your shoes, and thus making your solution more and more acceptable
> ==Reporter's questions==
> Avoid: "can", "is", "are", "do", or "does"—Can be answered with a simple Yes/No
> Use: "who", "what", "when", "where", "why", "how"—Encourage your counterpart to think and speak expansively. P.S- Avoid "why".

### Examples

- "Does this look like something you would like?" —> "How does this look to you?" or "What about this works for you? or "What about this doesn't work for you?"
- "Why did you do it?" —> "What caused you to do it?"

> All negotiation is an information-gathering process—Chris

- What about this is important to you?
- How can I help to make this better for us?
- How would you like me to proceed?
- What is it that brought us into this situation?
- How can we solve this problem?
- What's the objective?/What are we trying to accomplish here?
- How am I supposed to do that?

> The implication of any well-designed calibrated question is that you want what the other guy wants but you need his intelligence to overcome the problem. —Chirss
> This really appeals to very aggressive or egoistical counterparts☝

## Regulate your emotions

Even with all the best techniques and strategy, you need to control your emotions if you want to have any hope of coming out on top
When you are assaulted, don't counterattack. Instead, disarm your counterpart by asking a calibrated question.
In such cases the best option is to turn your state into somewhat more positive and lowering the hostage mentality in your counterpart by asking a question or even offering an apology—"You're right. That was a bit harsh"

## How to not get paid

==Steps:==

1. "No"-oriented question: "Have you given up on settling the amicably?"
2. That's right: "It seems that you feel my bill is not justified."
3. Calibrated question: "How does this bill violate our agreement?"
4. "No"-oriented question: "Are you saying I misled you?" "Are you saying I didn't do as you asked?" "Are you saying I failed you"
5. Labeling and mirroring: "It seems like you feel my work was subpar"
6. To say no to a offer lower than expected: "How am I supposed to do accept that?"
7. Extreme case: Label to flatter their sense of control and power: "It seems like you are the type of person who prides himself on the way he does business—rightfully so—and has a knack for not only expanding the pie but making the ship run more efficiently."
8. Extreme case: Long pause and "No"-oriented question: "Do you want to be known as someone who doesn't fulfill agreements?"

## Key lessons

- **Listener has more power than the speaker. Harness the talker's energy for your own ends.**
- Don't try to force
- Use calibrated question
- Avoid angry emotion reactions
- There is always a team on the other side. If you are not influencing those behind the table, you are vulnerable
  P.S-Try to include people who are responsible for the final decision but not present while the negotiation. Eg: "I wonder what the board members think about this deal", "How does this affect the rest of your team?", "How on board are the people not on this call?", "What do you colleagues see as their main challenges in this area?"

# Chapter 8 | Guarantee Execution

> "Yes" is nothing without a "How"—chris
> So plan and guarantee the execution after getting the "Yes"

## Forced empathy

Your tone plays a major role when it comes to this. This introduces a positive dynamic to the conversation, where you counterpart feels your pain. This is even more powerful if there fears are labelled by you already (You've already been empathic)

> Negotiations are often called:  
> "The art of letting someone else have your way."

## Dealing with jerks and spotting liars

It is best not to go chin to chin with aggressive one. Fall back to calibrated question. Main focus is better to stay on the strategy of dodge and weave.

### The 7-35-55 Percent Rule

> 7-Words  
> 35-Tone  
> 55-Body Language  
> Pay attention to the tone and body language, if it doesn't aligns with the words. Your counterpart is probably lying.

### The Rule of three

Get your counterpart to agree three times in the same conversation.

1. "Yes" on first commitment
2. "That's right" on hearing you summarize.
3. Answer to a "how" or "what"

> Liars tend to speak in complex sentences in an attempt to win over their suspicious counterpart.—Chris

## Humanizing

Using your own name and your counterpart's name turn the conversation more polite and comfortable
Humanize your self. Use your name to introduce yourself. Say it in a fun, friendly way. Let them enjoy the interaction, too.

## How to get you counterparts to bid against themselves

It is usually possible safe to say "No" four times before you actually say it

1. "How am I supposed to do that?"
2. "Your offer is very generous, I'm sorry, that just doesn't work for me"
3. "I'm sorry but I'm afraid I just can't do that"
4. I'm sorry, no"
   Remember: The art of closing a deal is staying focused to the very end. Remain focused on the goal and don't let your mind wander. There are crucial points to the finale where you must stay focused

## Key lessons

- Make the illusion of control using calibrated question.
- Follow the 7-35-55 rule
- Get "Yes" three times
- Humanize yourself
- Respectfully disagree with calibrated questions and the use forced empathy.

# Chapter 9 | Bargain Hard

Author writes about a bargaining experience that got him a $36,000 Toyota 4Runner in $30,000

1. Right timing
2. Humanizing
3. Forced empathy
4. Calibrated question to decline the offer
5. Staying focused till the end
   _The whole conversation was based on these 5 points_

## What type are you?

1. Analyst
   ==Moto:== As much time as it takes to get it right
   ==Response to calibrated questions:== Delayed. They would need time to think and come up with the right answer
2. Assertive
   ==Moto:== Time is money  
   Best way to deal with them is to listen to them. Once they feel the are being understood, they will listen to you.
3. Accommodators.
   ==Moto:== Time should be spent building relationships  
   If they're your counterpart, be sociable and friendly
   ==Response to calibrated questions:== Quick because they love to talk about their ideas

> Don't treat other the way you want to be treated; treat them the way they need to be treated.—Chris
> Link to know more about the 3 types: http://info.blackswanltd.com/3-types

## Taking a punch and punching back

> Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the mouth—Mike Tyson
> Take a deep breath, allow little anger, and channel it—at the proposal, **not the person—**and say, "I don't see how that would ever work" or decline using calibrated questions "What else could you do to make this a good deal for me?"
> And sometimes to stir up the momentum of the negotiation it is okay to hit them in the face with a high anchor.

> The person across the table is never the problem. The unsolved issue is. So focus on the issue and never create an enemy—Chris Voss

## Ackerman Bargaining

The systematized and easy-to-remember process has only four steps:

1. Set your target price (your goal)
2. Set your first offer at 65% of your target price
3. Calculate three raises of decreasing increments (to 85, 95, and 100%)
4. Use lots of empathy and different ways of saying "No" to get the other side to counter before you increase your offer.
5. When calculating the final amount, use precise, non-round numbers like, say $3789 rather than $3800. It gives the number credibility and weight
6. On your final number, throw in a non-monetary item (that they probably don't want) to show you're at your limit.

> You fall to your highest level of preparation—Chris

## Key lessons

- Prepare, prepare, prepare!!
- Be ready to take a punch
- Identify your counterpart's negotiating style
- Punch back without getting angry at the person
- Use Ackerman technique

# Chapter 10 | Find The Black Swan

> The unknown unknowns are Black Swans

## Uncovering unknown unknowns

Every situation is new. So enter every negotiation with a beginners mindset to learn about the situation and your counterpart. Don't overvalue your experience and learning. This will let you uncover the unknown unknowns.

> What you don't know can kill you or your deal—Chris
> Eg. The world didn't tell Steve jobs that it wanted an iPad: he uncovered our need, that Black Swan, without us knowing the information was there.

- Ask a lot of questions
- Observe carefully
- Challenge you assumptions

## Three types of leverage

"Leverage is the ability to inflict loss and withhold gain." To get leverage, you have to persuade your counterpart that they have something real to lose if the deal falls through.

### Positive Leverage

"Ability to provide—or withhold—things that your counterpart wants." Use calibrated questions to uncover their hidden desire. Once you know it, you control what they want.

### Negative Leverage

It's a negotiator's ability to make his counterpart suffer
Negative leverage delivery example: "It seems like you strongly value the fact that you've always paid on time." or "it seems like you don't care what position you are leaving me in"

### Normative Leverage

Using the other party's norms and standards to advance your position. No one likes to look like a hypocrite, So if you manage to show conflict between their norms and actions. You got the leverage.

## Tackling the impossible

The reason why a lot of people reach the level of you declaring their counterpart "Crazy" is because of these missing or unaddressed issues

1. They are ill-informed: When both party's aren't on the same page, it certainly becomes hard for them to see each other's perspective.
2. They are constrained: They are literally tied up in a bad place
3. They have other interests: They have needs and desire that you don't yet understand.
   Solving:
4. Get Face time
5. Observe unguarded moments: Pay close attention to your counterparts verbal/non-verbal response to external situations (You questions majorly)

> Don't avoid honest, clear conflict—chris
