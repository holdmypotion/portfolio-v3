# You Don't have to be a Genius

> Crafting something is a long uncertain process a maker should show her work.

> Give what you have. To someone, it may be better than you dare to think.
> Creativity is always a collaborative outcome. A result that generates from the results created long before

## Be an Amateur

> That's all any of us are: amateurs. We don't live long enough to be anything else.

> In a beginner's mind there are many possibilities. In the expert's mind, there are few.
> Being an amateur means to try out things, following you gut, keep changing, experimenting and taking chances. And after all sharing the process and the results. In the process of doing things in an unprofessional way, they make new discoveries. After all contributing something is better that contributing nothing.
> Think out loud!  
> If you get obsessed by something, spend a lot of time learning and thinking out loud about it.  
> That's what amateurs do.

> The best way to get started on the path to sharing your work is to think about what you want to learn, and make a commitment to learning it in front of others.
> Forget out being a professional, don't worry about how you'll make a career of it (for now). Just share what you love, and the people who love the same will find you.

## You can't find your voice if you don't use it.

> In this day and age, if your work isn’t online, it doesn’t exist.

> Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose. You are already naked.”  
> -Steve Jobs

## Read Obituaries

# Think Process, Not Product.

> The work is all that's happened in the day. It is the process, not a thing.

## Become a Documentarian of What You Do

> In order for connection to happen, we have to allow ourselves to be seen—really seen.  
> —Brene Brown

> Become a documentarian of what you do. Start a work journal: Write your thoughts down in a notebook, or speak them into an audio recorder. Keep a scrapbook. Take a lot of photographs of your work at different stages in your process. Shoot video of you working. This isn’t about making art, it’s about simply keeping track of what’s going on around you. Take advantage of all the cheap, easy tools at your disposal—these days, most of us carry a fully functional multimedia studio around in our smartphones.
