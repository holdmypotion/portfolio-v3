description: '- There’s a benefit to being naive about the norms of the world—deciding from scratch what seems like the right thing to do, instead of just doing what others do.
- There’s a big difference between being self-employed and being a business owner. Being self-employed feels like freedom until you realize that if you take time off, your business crumbles. To be a true business owner, make it so that you could leave for a year, and when you came back, your business would be doing better than when you left.
- When people would ask, “What are you doing to grow your company?” I’d say, “Nothing! I’m trying to get it to stop growing! I don’t like this. It’s too big.” They thought that was the weirdest thing. Doesn’t every business want to be as big as possible?'

# What is a business

- A world where you control all the laws. So do you, don't just accept what other people do in there business and copy.
- If people react positively to the idea go ahead otherwise don't pursue it. You'll be fighting an uphill battle.
- Every decision should be based on what is best for the customers. Ask your customers and they'll let you know what’s the best course of action.
- Start small, don't worry about being big. It is not worth it anyway. Enjoy the process and put in your 100%.

# Ideas, Execution, and Expansion!

![Anything you want - idea n execution](//images.ctfassets.net/8z3meboy5dgi/1PJxXrEU675dQeZLeStX22/f6a7a8fe577c6c7ad9297700f60a2e8e/idea_execution.png)

- Ideas are just multipliers to execution
- It is better to have multiple small customers than have big sharks tailoring your company according to their needs. Don't try to get big customers. Don't let the client be your boss, it is your business after all.
- Plan and plan for everything.
  - “OK, make a plan that requires only $1,000. Go!”
  - “Now make a plan for ten times as many customers. Go!”
  - “Now do it without a website. Go!”
  - “Now make all your initial assumptions wrong, and have it work anyway. Go!”
  - “Now show how you would franchise it. Go!”

You can’t pretend there’s only one way to do it. Your first idea is just one of many options. No business goes as planned, so make ten radically different plans. Same thing with your current path in life:

- Now you’re living in New York City, obsessed with success. Go!
- Now you’re a free spirit, backpacking around Thailand. Go!
- Now you’re a confident extrovert and everyone loves you. Go!
- Now you’re married and your kids are your life. Go!
- Now you spend a few years in relative seclusion, reading and walking. Go!

# Delegate but don't abdicate

- Trust, but verify
