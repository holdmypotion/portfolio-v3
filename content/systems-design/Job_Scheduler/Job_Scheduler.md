# Job Scheduler System Design

Distributed system for scheduling and executing background jobs, cron tasks, and workflows with reliability.

## Key Requirements

- Schedule jobs with cron expressions, handle dependencies
- Execute exactly once, retry failed jobs with backoff
- Handle millions of jobs, low latency dispatching
- Fault tolerance and comprehensive monitoring

## Core Components

- **Job Scheduler**: Cron parsing and scheduling with leader election
- **Job Queue**: Priority-based queuing with worker pools
- **Storage**: Job metadata, execution history, state tracking
- **Monitoring**: Health checks, metrics, alerting, admin dashboard
