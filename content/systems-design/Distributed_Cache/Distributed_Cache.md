# Distributed Cache System Design

Distributed caching system for high-performance applications with consistent hashing and fault tolerance.

## Key Requirements

- Get/Put/Delete operations with TTL support
- < 1ms latency, 1M+ QPS, 99.99% availability
- Eventually consistent, fault tolerant

## Core Components

- **Consistent Hashing**: Hash ring with virtual nodes for distribution
- **Cache Nodes**: In-memory storage with LRU eviction
- **Replication**: Data stored on N consecutive nodes
- **Client Library**: Connection pooling and failover logic
